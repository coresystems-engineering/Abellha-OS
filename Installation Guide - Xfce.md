First, if it is not installed, install the xfce4 and the xfce4-goodies with (and remember to have Debian/Xubuntu installed with xfce4-session):
sudo apt update && sudo apt install xfce4 xfce4-goodies -y
Now you will be changing the background image: click on the menu on top, settings, Desktop and change it to the Abéllha OS' file on Wallpapers folder.
Tip: It can be either light or dark.
Make sure you downloaded the wallpapers. Now go to settings again, panel and move it down by unchecking the lock panel and moving
it to the bottom and locking it again. Now in the items tab, select the menu app with a mouse and edit it with the edit button on the bottom.

Now for this to be really Abéllha OS and not a modded Debian/Ubuntu Xfce session, run this command:
sudo nano /etc/os-release
As nano appears change everything on the file to:
PRETTY_NAME="Abéllha OS"
NAME="Abéllha OS"
VERSION_ID="1"
VERSION="1 (Xenon)"
VERSION_CODENAME=xenon
DEBIAN_VERSION_FULL=1.0

SUPPORT_URL="https://www.debian.org/support"
BUG_REPORT_URL="https://bugs.debian.org/"

Press CTRL + O, Enter and CTRL + X
